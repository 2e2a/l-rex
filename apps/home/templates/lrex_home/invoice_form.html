        Invoices are only available for residents of Germany (for tax reasons). By default, 19% of the chosen amount will
        be added on top for taxes. If you want to pay exactly the chosen amount, tick the box
        <i>Including 19% taxes</i>. If you need the invoice to be more specific (e.g., because further details are required
        for reimbursement by your university), you can edit the <i>invoice subject</i> field.<br>
        <br>
        After submitting the form, you will receive a confirmation e-mail. We will get back to you as soon as possible with
        an invoice, usually within a few days. If you do not receive an e-mail, please contact us under
        <i>support@l-rex.de</i>.
